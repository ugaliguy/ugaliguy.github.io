                I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp's intensive 19 week program to train to become a web developer. I am seeking my first job as either a junior developer or data engineer. I am a lifelong learner who loves to solve challenging problems. Currently, I am teaching myself Machine Learning.

            I grew up in New York City and lived in Madison Wisconsin for several years. I earned my Master of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin in Madison. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya, where I taught math and physics at the secondary level. Afterwards, I moved to Chicago, where I worked for TAP Pharmaceuticals and Pearson Education while also taking courses at Loyola University in programming and database management. A few years ago I went back to graduate school to pursue a PhD in Mathematics (I am ABD). My area of research is link homology theories, but I am also interested in applications of algebraic topology to computer science (e.g. Concurrency and Topological Data Analysis)

            My interests and hobbies include music and horror literature. I love learning to play musical intruments and have taken lessons on guitar, bass, banjo, and dobro. I love all kinds of music, but am partial to Pre-World War II Blues, Honky Tonk, Norwegian Black Metal, Australian Death Metal, and American Doom Metal. I am an avid reader of horror  - especially the works of Thomas Ligotti and H.P. Lovecraft.

            I have no quirks to speak of. I have eaten termites in East Africa and have jumped into Lake Michigan on New Years Day, but I do not endeavor to project an image of eccentricity. I occasionally yell at invisible squirrels (but only when I trip over them). I do not attract attention by riding Penny-Farthings or celebrating Trouserless Tuesdays.
