      <p>
        In the fifth week of Dev Bootcamp, we looked a bit more in depth into Ruby. In particular, we had our first taste of classes. For this entry, I want to discuss how the <span class="var_name">Enumerable</span> module can enrich your classes. As usual, this is not an exhaustive survey, but rather a taste of what you can do.
    </p>

    <h4> The <span class="var_name">Enumerable</span> module</h4>

    <p>
        When we first learn to program (in any language), we learn to write code that repeats/iterates a task - usually by means of a for-loop 
        or some other control structure. For example,
    </p>   

    <pre>
      <code>
          for i in 1..5
              p "Splat! "
          end

          # This will output

          "Splat! "
          "Splat! "
          "Splat! "
          "Splat! "
          "Splat! 
      </code> 
    </pre>

    <p>
        So far, so good, but what if we wanted to print out the contents of an array. For example,
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          metal = ["Portal", "1349", "Yob", "Marduk"]
          for i in 1..metal.length
              p metal[i-1]
          end

          # This will output

          "Portal"
          "1349"
          "Yob"
          "Marduk"
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        This example leads to the same output, a list of things printed one at a time, but notice that the code is slightly more complicated. 
        We have to make sure we have gotten the array's indices correct. However, in Ruby, we learn that arrays have a special method 
        <span class="var_name"> each </span> that allows us to iterate without worrying about the indices.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          metal = ["Portal", "1349", "Yob", "Marduk"]
          metal.each do |band|
              p band
          end

          # This will output

          "Portal"
          "1349"
          "Yob"
          "Marduk"
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        We get the same output, but at greater simplicity. This is because the class Array has the <span class="var_name"> each </span> method. However, there are other things we can do to an array. For example, we can apply <span class="var_name"> any? </span> to see if an object is an element of the array. These methods are not unique to arrays, but can be given to other classes by including the <span class="var_name">Enumerable</span> module in 
        the class definition and then defining an instance method called <span class="var_name">each</span>.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          class Class_Name {
            include Enumerable
            def each
            # put code here
            end

            # define the rest of your class
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        By including the <span class="var_name">Enumerable</span> module in our class, we gain access to a wide variety of methods, such as the searching and sorting methods that we see for arrays. In other languages, we would have to construct our own object-specific methods. Let's look at a particular method.
    </p>

    <h4>Example <span class="var_name">Enumerable#group_by</span></h4>

    <p>
       The <span class="var_name">group_by</span> method takes a block of code and returns a hash, where the block is executed for each object. For each unique block return value, the returned hash gets a key; the value for that key is an array of all the objects for which the block returned that value.
       For example,
    </p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
          metal = ["Portal", "1349", "Yob", "Marduk", "Mayhem", "Cultes des Ghoules", "Blut Aus Nord", "Tsjuder", "Dodheimsgard"]

          # We can ask if any bands in the above array have the letter 'M'
          metal.group_by {|band| band =~/M/}

          # The resulting hash is  

          {nil=>["Portal", "1349", "Yob", "Cultes des Ghoules", "Blut Aus Nord", "Tsjuder", "Dodheimsgard"], 
          0=>["Marduk", "Mayhem"]}

          # where the first array is consists of those bans that do not have an 'M' (i.e. band =~/M/ is false), 
          # while the second array consists of # those 
          # that do. I need to figure out how to specify a meaningful key. In this case, 'nil' means 'false' and '0' means 'true'.

          # Another example -  sorry, I tried to find something other than an array to apply group_by to.
          # I couldn't make it work for hashes (yet!)

          (1..16).group_by { |i| i%7 }   

          # The output is hash of integer keys (between 0 <= i <= 6 - i.e. possible remainders upon division by 7) 
          # whose values are arrays of integers with remainder i.
          {1=>[1, 8, 15], 2=>[2, 9, 16], 3=>[3, 10], 4=>[4, 11], 5=>[5, 12], 6=>[6, 13], 0=>[7, 14]}



      </code>
    </pre>
  
    <p class="last">
      Once we start constructing our own classes, then we should be able to figure out good implementations of the methods offered to us 
      by the <span class="var_name">Enumerable</span> module.
