1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a good experience for me. My pair partner was very interested in design and had already drawn several different wireframes.
We discussed a few options, but decided to work one wireframe together.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

At this point, I think I could have created the blog-template file without a wireframe. However, I respect the process of creating one.
In an earlier challenge, we outlined the six steps of web site design. With that in mind, I can see that wireframing is an essential part of the design process and would not want to develop a site without one.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

Simplicity (how's that for a simple answer). We sought to add only the essential features that would lead to our blog-template.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about (and used) the <article> tag for making each blog post and independent section.
I also used <nav> inside of  <footer> for making a separate section for the 'return to homepage' link.
For each blog post I plan on using the <date> tag.
